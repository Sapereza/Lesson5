Create your own well-designed 3-page website (Tours, Schedule, History) populated with information related to the Statue of Liberty.
Include a style sheet.
Each page must have different info and images related to the page title including banner, sidebar images and content.
Upload your files to the server, then test the website to be sure the links work and you can navigate back and forth between the pages.
Make sure all images display properly.
